 how long is forever, anyway?

Wretchedness leapt over me  
as I heard those words:  
“I could forget you in a day or two.”  
The thought of meaning nothing to you—  
a blow to my self-esteem.  

Though you eventually grew used to me,  
I overdosed that night.  
To forget this ever happened,  
to erase my existence,  
to silence the inner turmoil—  
I did everything to get past that feeling,  
the feeling to break away from you.  
Though stronger than the bond we had,  
I held on to you,  
thinking of a contented tomorrow.  

Stranger to me,  
you weren’t one to my emotions.  
“I have been through the same.”  
But was that meant to be comforting?  

“Is an experience of similar pain comforting to some?” I wondered.  
Knowing your scars cut deeper,  
it hurt me more.  

“Is there an escape to this?”  
I asked, like a child cornered in a room.  
Calmly, you explained all its nuances:  
“Learn to like your solitude;  
be your own solace.”  

You are still here with me,  
woven into my everyday,  
part of my happiest moments.  

But how long till you leave?  
I ponder fearfully,  
for forever is only a promise—  
how long is forever, anyway?  

Forever is how long I want you to stay,  
how long I can listen to you talk  
about anything and everything.  
Still, forever feels too short  
for all the time I want with you.  

The longer we talked,  
the shorter the nights became.  
I have gotten used to you.  
You say you do too.  
But will this lead us anywhere?  
At the crossover of forevers,  
we shall step into the nethers.  

The nethers will decide  
our fate,  
of what would be of us:  
“Withstand, and you shall remain together;  
refute, and fall apart.”

The water reflects the colors of the sky, creating a mirror-like image. The sun is setting in the distance, casting a warm glow over the scene.](forever.png "Forever")
