You've forgotten me,  
And I have too.  

A moment passed,  
Passed us by.  

We gazed into each other's souls,  
Our eyes burning with desire.  
Akin to predators on the hunt.  

I should have held you close,  
Told you how I felt.  
But apart we remained,  
Apart in the night sky.  

The moon bears witness,  
Bears witness to my unrequited longing.  
Oh, how I crave your lethal drug!

 colorful spiral. The spiral stretches upwards, disappearing into a bright light. The man's expression is contemplative as he gazes into the depths of the spiral.](lost.png "Lost")
