You've forgotten me, 
And I have too.

A moment passed, 
Passed us by.

We gazed into each other's souls,
Our eyes burning with desire.
Akin to predators on the hunt.

I should have held you close,
Told you how I felt.
But apart we remained,
Apart in the night sky.

The moon bears witness,
Bears witness to my unrequited longing.
Oh, how I crave your lethal drug!
